Alpine Linux with mimalloc for fastest multi-threaded memory allocation

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will give you a base Alpine image with some additional tweaks like some bin‚Äôs (curl, tini, shadow, tzdata) which are present by default. It will also execute the script ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh``` via [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini).

If used as a base image for your own image simply leave out your own **ENTRYPOINT** to use the default one and provide your own ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh```.

# COMPOSE ‚úÇÔ∏è
```yaml
name: "alpine"
services:
  alpine:
    image: "11notes/alpine:3.22.1"
    container_name: "alpine"
    environment:
      TZ: "Europe/Zurich"
    restart: "always"
```

# BUILD üöß
```yaml
FROM 11notes/alpine:stable
# switch to root during setup
USER root
# setup your app
RUN set -ex; \
  setup your app
# add custom entrypoint to image
COPY ./entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin
# start image as 1000:1000
USER docker
```

| `gid` | 1000 | [group identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier) |
| `home` | / | home directory of user docker |

# ENVIRONMENT üìù

| `DEBUG` | Will activate debug option for container image and app (if available) | |

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [3.22.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/alpine/tags?name=3.22.1)
* [stable](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/alpine/tags?name=stable)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:3.22.1``` you can use ```:3``` or ```:3.22```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!
