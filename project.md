${{ content_synopsis }} This image will give you a base Alpine image with some additional tweaks like some bin’s (curl, tini, shadow, tzdata) which are present by default. It will also execute the script ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh``` via [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini).

If used as a base image for your own image simply leave out your own **ENTRYPOINT** to use the default one and provide your own ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh```.
